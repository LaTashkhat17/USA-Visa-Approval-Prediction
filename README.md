US Visa Approval Prediction Web App ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

An end-to-end Machine Learning Project that predicts whether a US visa application will be approved or denied, based on applicant and employer details.
Built using FastAPI, Scikit-learn, and integrated with Google Drive for model management.

Project Overview

This project automates the process of predicting visa approval outcomes using historical US visa data.
It covers the complete MLOps lifecycle â€” from data ingestion to model deployment via a web interface.

Key Features:

Automatic data validation, transformation, training, and evaluation pipeline

Model trained and uploaded to Google Drive automatically

Web-based FastAPI app for real-time predictions

Reusable pipeline for retraining and model updates

Google Drive integration for model storage and versioning

Tech Stack

Frontend	HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend	FastAPI, Uvicorn
ML / Data	Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, PyDrive

 How It Works
1. Training Pipeline

Run end-to-end model training using:

Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/
Vs code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Git: https://git-scm.com/

For flowchart
https://whimsical.com/a

Data link:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset

Workflow
constant
config_entity
artifact_entity
conponent

pipeline
app.py / demo.py


How to run?
git clone https://github.com/LaTashkhat17/USA-Visa-Approval-Prediction

conda create -n visa python=3.8 -y
conda activate visa
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then visit:

http://localhost:8080/train


This will:

Ingest and validate the dataset

Transform features (encoding, scaling, etc.)

Train an ML model (classification)

Evaluate it

Upload the trained model to Google Drive

2. Prediction via Web App

Start the app:

uvicorn app:app --reload


Then open:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Youâ€™ll see a form like this 
Enter visa application details and click Predict Visa Status â€” the model will:

Download the trained model from Google Drive (if not cached)

Preprocess your inputs

Predict whether the visa will be approved or not approved

Example Prediction
Feature	Example Input
Continent	Asia
Education of Employee	Masterâ€™s
Has Job Experience	Y
Requires Job Training	N
Number of Employees	12000
Region of Employment	West
Prevailing Wage	69370.58
Unit of Wage	Year
Full Time Position	Y
Company Age	115

Output: Visa Approved

Google Drive Integration

This project uses PyDrive for automatic model uploads/downloads.

Setup Steps

Create a project in Google Cloud Console
.

Enable the Google Drive API.

Download your client_secrets.json and place it in your project root.

The first time you run the app, a browser window will open for Google login authorization.

The model will then be saved under your Drive folder.

 Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Key libraries:

fastapi
uvicorn
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
PyDrive
imblearn
jinja2
python-dotenv

Local Development

Start local FastAPI server:

uvicorn app:app --reload


Re-train model:

python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:8080/train
